	<h2>My Dyketactics! Research</h2>

	<p>Although this research is for my job, I went a bit off the rails and decided to just learn as much as I could.</p>


	<p>When you google “Dyketactics!” an article from the Philadelphia Gay News comes up:</p>

	<a href="https://epgn.com/2022/10/25/local-lesbian-activist-group-fought-for-equality-in-the-70s/">PGN Dyketactics! Article</a>

	<p>It’s really extensive and helpful. But where could I go from here? From the article and my coworkers, I had a few names to work with.</p>

	<p>Names of Dyketactics! members I learned from the documentary or the bookstore:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Sherrie Cohen</li>
		<li>Kathy Hogan (Fire)</li>
		<li>Paola Bacchetta</>
	</ul>

	<p>Doing just a tiny bit more googling I found an article by
		<a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6835c2fv#:~:text=in%20the%201970s.-,Dyketactics!,founded%20in%201975%20in%20Philadelphia.">Bacchetta</a>
that mentions a few other names:</p>


	<ul>
		<li>Monica A. Hand</li>
		<li>Barbara Ruth</li>
		<li>Julie Blackwomon</li>
		<li>Chea Villanueva</li>
		<li>Pauline Miriam</li>
		<li>Linda Norwood</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Now we've got some materials to work with! It's getting good!</h3>

	<p>Bacchetta references "Smash the Church, Smash the State!: Early Days of Gay Liberation" edited by Tommi Avicolli Mecca twice in her bibliography. Mecca was involved in Gay Liberation Front, a post-stonewall gay activist group, founded the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Archives (now the William Way Archives), and was a co-founder of RadicalQueens, a Philadelphia-based group of drag queens and gender-nonconforming queers. The world of literary, artistic, and academic queer people is small, and shelving books with the same few names only makes it feel smaller. Needless to say, working with queer Philly materials for the last year of my life, Mecca’s name had definitely come up before.</p>

	<p>I looked into getting the book, and to my luck, there was a copy at the Pratt Manhattan library! How lucky!</p>

	<p>In the book, there are two essays on Dyketactics!. One by Bacchetta and one by Ruth. They talk about the strategies and mission of Dyketactics!. It always amazes me to read about activist groups of the past, and how especially in lesbian feminist spaces, they were often asking the exact same questions we are now, just 50 years ago. I can never tell if this is motivational or depressing, but either way it’s interesting.</p>

	<p>Bacchetta mentioned a few periodicals that Dyketactics! either wrote for or were featured in: Hera, Lesbian Connection, and Off Our Backs. I had heard of a few of these before (Hera was a Philly-based lesbian newsletter and Off Our Backs was a notorious controversial radical-feminist magazine started in the ‘70s), but now I had my work cut out for me.</p>


	<p>I tried to find more information using the Lesbian Herstory Archives’ online collections and they actually have a 1976 radio 
	<a href="https://herstories.prattinfoschool.nyc/omeka/items/show/1389">interview</a>
interview with Cohen and Norwood, which will be great for the documentary.</p>
