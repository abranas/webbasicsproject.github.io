	<h2>My Findings</h2>

	<p>I went to the Lesbian Herstory Archives and did research! Truly a dream come true for me, getting paid to research Philadelphia lesbian history is all I have ever wanted. The documentary really wants good images or anything that would look night in a film.</p>


	<p>Here's a basic rundown of how the LHA is set up:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><strong>1st Floor</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<strong>Room with the couch</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Books (fiction / memoir / nonfiction / poetry)</li>
				<li>Subject files</li>
				<li>Various random ephemera items</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
		<td>
			<strong>Room with long wooden table</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Books not in English</li>
				<li>Pulp Fiction or Survival Books</li>
				<li>Photography Collections</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><strong>2nd Floor</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<strong>Room to the left of the Gertrude Stein cutout</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Collections by geographic location (by state and city in the U.S., by country for everywhere else)</li>
				<li>Collections by names of individuals</li>
				<li>Collections by organization name</li>
				<li>Closet of special collections</li>
				<li>Bookshelf and collections belonging to Marge MacDonald</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
		<td>
			<strong>Room to the right of the Gertrude Stein cutout</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Periodicals in English</li>
				<li>Closet of international periodicals and oversized/overstock periodicals</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>


	<p>I looked in the organization collections and found two folders on Dyketactics!. In here, I found the press releases and various legal documents, some flyers for fundraisers, and even their checks that said “Dyketactics!” on them.</p>

	<p>I looked under the individual people’s files, and didn’t find as much as I wanted. There were no folders for:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Norwood</li>
		<li>Bacchetta</li>
		<li>Cohen</li>
		<li>Hand</li>
		<li>Morgan</li>
	</ul>

	<p>There were folders on, but none of the information was about Dyketactics!:</p>

		<ul>
		<li>Ruth
		<ul>
				<li>Information on her career as a writer and poet</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Villanueva
		<ul>
				<li>Information on her career as a writer</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
		<li>Blackwood
		<ul>
				<li>information on her career as a photographer</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Hogan (Fire)
		<ul>
		<li>information on other activist work</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>


	<p>I looked under the geographical collections and found Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (also 2 folders). Here, there are similar press releases about Dyketactics! and even some ‘70s advertisements about Giovanni’s Room, which was very sweet. The Philly-lesbian newsletter Hera wasn’t in the periodicals room, but it was in the Philly folder. There was even a photo in the newsletter of Dyketactics! in the courtroom.</p>


	<p>The real exciting find, which I had vaguely remembered seeing when I visited the LHA a year ago, is Kathy Hogan’s leather jacket that says “Dyketactics!” on the back. I’ll have a chance to go back to the archives with someone who has a camera to get better documentation of that one.</p>
